# jeopardy_project

This is one of a few Codecademy challenge projects that I completed. The project involved analyzing a data set consisting of Jeopardy questions over a 20+ year period. There were some prompted questions that I strove to answer, and a few of my own questions that I came up with and answered. In at least one case, I included the Codecademy solution for the purposes of comparison with my code, and have labeled their solution as such.

I completed this project using Python 3.8 and Jupyter notebook. The only package I used was Pandas. It's not clear to me if I can include the actual data file or not; however, I *can* include my Jupyter Notebook, as I've come to realize that it shows the output of a cell from the last time the cell was run. In this way you can see my solution to the project, the code I wrote, and what it outputs.
